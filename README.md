# Automatically Labelled EUV and XRay Incident Solarflare Catalog
### NOTE: Does not run on ARM chips (Linux/X86 only)
## ALEXIS is a pipeline that can re-create the integrated X-Ray flux of the full solar disk into the emission from discrete regions in the Extreme UV. 
This pipeline is intended to help in identifying and cataloging solar flares. 

The main goal of the ALEXIS pipeline is to be able to create an independent data product to localize solar flares. 
A flare list containing the event date, peak-time, Helioprojective Cartesian coordinates, NOAA AR number and HARP identifier is returned. 

One can either:

1. Download the event list:

If you are only interested in downloading the flare catalog, proceed to the data_products directory. 
Inside you will find a google link to download the databases and data products. 
Please register following the link.

2. Run the pipeline for yourself:

If you are interested in running the pipeline for a time-period of your choice from May 5, 2010 to March 1, 2020.

Please go to the "onboarding" sub-directory, register, and download (or run) each of the sub-scripts located within the "pipeline" sub-directory.
