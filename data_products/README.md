# 3. Running the pipeline on a linux machine
**SQlite databases that are created from the *onboarding* directory will reside in the data_products directory**

 If you dont wish to run the onboarding yourself, there are 5 main files you will have to download from the links below. Some of these files are compressed and you must follow the instructions to uncompress. In total, you will need ~120GB of storage space.

#### Thegoogle drive folder will contain all the databases needed to run the pipeline.
